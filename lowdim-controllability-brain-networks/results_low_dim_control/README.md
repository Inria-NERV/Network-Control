#Simulations on synthetic networks  
3 scripts starting with the word simu_, which serve to demonstrate the concepts of low-dimensional controllability in synthetic networks (Hierarchical Modular Small-world network model).

#Application: characterize low-dimensional controllability in real structural brain networks  
3 scripts starting with the word ukb_ (stands for UK-biobank), which serve to demonstrate the applicability and benefit of considering low-dimensional controllability and define a new control centrality metric.
